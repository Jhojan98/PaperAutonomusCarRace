# Code in LaTeX

This repository contains a document written in LaTeX as part of a test to generate a technical article. The document includes several sections such as Introduction, Methods and Materials, Results, Conclusions, among others.

## Repository Content

- **main.tex**: Main file that compiles the complete document.
- **bibliography.bib**: Bibliography file in BibTeX format.
- **Sections**: `.tex` files containing different sections of the document, such as `Abstract.tex`, `Introduction.tex`, etc.
- **images/**: Folder containing the images used in the document.
- **main.pdf**: The generated PDF document, which can be found [here](./main.pdf).

## How to Compile the Document

To compile the document and generate the PDF, make sure you have a LaTeX compiler installed, such as `pdflatex`. Then, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
pdflatex main.tex
```

This will generate the `main.pdf` file in the current directory.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the use of LaTeX for creating high-quality technical and academic documents.
